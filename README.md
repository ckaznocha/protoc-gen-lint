A plug-in for Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
compiler to check `.proto` files for style violations.

## About
This plug-in will check a `.proto` file for violations of Google's Protocol
Buffers [Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style).
The Protocol Buffers compiler already reports on compilation errors; by using
this plug-in you are also able to retrieve those compilation error with out
writing any files which could be helpful for things like IDE integrations.

## Installation
Download `protoc-gen-lint` and make sure it's available in your PATH. Once it's
in your PATH, `protoc` will be able to make use of the plug-in.

### Dependencies
You must have a working version of Google's Protocol Buffers compiler `protoc`
in your PATH. You can download it
[here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads)

### go get
If you have a go environment already set up you can use go get to install.
```
go get github.com/ckaznocha/protoc-gen-lint
```

### Download
Download the latest release for your operating system
[here](https://github.com/ckaznocha/protoc-gen-lint/releases/latest) then
rename it to `protoc-gen-lint` (or protoc-gen-lint.exe` for windows) and ensure
it's available in your PATH.

## Usage
```
protoc --lint_out=. *.proto
```

## TODO
* Write more tests
* Find out about any common protocol buffer smells to check for from the community
